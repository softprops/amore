def: a scala port of the ruby web framework Sinatra

## Goals/Todos
  - support a basic HTTP verb dsl  
  - support route matching
  - decide what to do for rendering responses. no erb, haml in scala land :(
  - impl on top of scala port of rack spec?
  - a cli? (invoke from command line)
  - keep it simple! get("/") {  }
  
~ scala can sing too

(someone has probably done this before but this is my educational exercise)
